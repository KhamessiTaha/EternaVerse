***1-Project Setup and Initial Planning


Create a detailed project roadmap
Set up version control (GitHub repository)
Choose a project management tool (Trello/GitHub Projects)


***2-Core Design Phase
a) Prototype the Pre-Big Bang Sandbox


Create initial wireframes for universe configuration interface
Design initial set of adjustable universal constants
Sketch out UI for initial conditions manipulation

b) Core Simulation Mechanics

Define mathematical models for:

Universe expansion
Cosmic event probabilities
Life emergence calculations


Create pseudocode for procedural generation algorithm


***3-Technology Preparation


Set up development environment

Install Node.js
Set up React + Next.js project
Configure TypeScript


Create initial project structure

Frontend directory
Backend directory
Simulation logic directory




***4-Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Focus
First milestone: Basic Universe Creation Sandbox


Implement basic UI for setting initial conditions
Create simple expansion simulation
Develop first version of procedural generation


***5-Prototype Development Sequence
Week 1-2: Core Mechanics Prototype


Initial universe configuration interface
Basic expansion simulation
Simple probability models for cosmic events

***Week 3-4: Visualization and Interaction

Implement React frontend
Create initial Unity WebGL event renderers
Basic interaction mechanisms
